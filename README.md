**Co-Founder @ [Ayudh Inc](https://github.com/ayudhinc) | Systems Thinker | AI Engineer | Creative Technologist**

I architect, prototype, and ship tools at the frontier of AI, 3D, and security.  
My work spans everything from intelligent Git commit firewalls to generative 3D studios—designed to empower engineers, creators, and researchers.

### 🧠 What I'm Building

🚧 **[CommitGuardian](https://github.com/ayudhinc/commitguardian)**  
_A privacy-first, AI-powered Git commit protection system._  
Prevents security leaks, slurs, and policy violations with local + cloud LLMs.  
Built in Rust. Wired into GitHub. Hardened for enterprise.

🧪 **[Sorcera.Studio](https://github.com/ayudhinc/sorcera)**  
_A 3D scene + final image generation platform for creatives._  
Prompt-to-render pipeline with Omniverse, Houdini, and real-time style control.  
Used for ads, games, and high-fidelity CG workflows.

📺 **[BoomBustDocs](https://github.com/ayudhinc/boombustdocs)**  
_A faceless, high-CPM YouTube doc channel powered by full-stack automation._  
From trend mining to scriptwriting to Runway-generated video assets.

📱 **[Sarsha](https://github.com/ayudhinc/sonave)**  
_HealthSensei360 mobile frontend for holistic health navigation._  
Connects wearables, predictions, and interventions in a beautifully minimal app.
